Description: This package performs a gene expression data analysis to
        detect condition-specific genes. Such genes are significantly
        up- or down-regulated in a small number of conditions. It does
        so by fitting a mixture of normal distributions to the
        expression values. Conditions can be environmental conditions,
        different tissues, organs or any other sources that you wish to
        compare in terms of gene expression.
